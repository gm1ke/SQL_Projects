 * Club Member Info
For this project, you play a role as a Data Analyst the must clean and restructure a dirty dataset.

A survey was done of current club members and we would like to restructure the data to a more organized and usable form.

In this project, I will :

1. Check for duplicate entries and remove them.
2. Remove extra spaces and/or other invalid characters.
3. Separate or combine values as needed.
4. Ensure that certain values (age, dates...) are within certain range.
5. Check for outliers.
6. Correct incorrect spelling or inputted data.
7. Adding new and relevant rows or columns to the new dataset.
8. Check for null or empty values.

Lets take a look at the first few rows to examine the data in its original form.
