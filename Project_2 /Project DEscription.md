# Project_2 Repository
This repository contains various SQL projects focused on data manipulation, analysis, and optimization. The queries and solutions provided here demonstrate the use of advanced SQL techniques, including:

### Data Aggregation and Grouping:

Queries that aggregate data by different dimensions, such as YEAR, MONTH, and SUPPLIER, to provide insights into sales performance, inventory levels, and more.

### Window Functions:

Implementation of window functions to calculate running totals (year-to-date sales), moving averages, rankings, and other metrics that require cumulative or comparative analysis over a specified window of data.

### Time Functions:

Use of SQL time functions to analyze data across different time periods, such as calculating average sales per quarter, identifying the most profitable day of the week, and comparing month-over-month growth.

### Subqueries:

Nested queries that help in filtering data, calculating intermediate results, or generating summaries that are then used in main queries for deeper analysis.

### Joins:

Complex joins between multiple tables to combine datasets, compare performance across different dimensions, and extract meaningful insights from related data sources.
CTEs (Common Table Expressions):

### Use of CTEs :

to structure complex queries in a more readable and maintainable way, facilitating tasks like calculating totals, filtering data, and creating temporary result sets for further analysis.
